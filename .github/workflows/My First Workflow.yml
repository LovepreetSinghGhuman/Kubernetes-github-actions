# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # Change this to use your self-hosted runner
    runs-on: self-hosted

    # This job checks out the repository, builds a Docker image from your Dockerfile,
    # tags it as hello-world-nginx:v1, and runs a container mapping port 8081 on the host
    # to port 80 in the container. It then lists running containers to verify the container is up.
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
